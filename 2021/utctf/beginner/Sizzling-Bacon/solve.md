Description: My buddy Francis is really into Bacon. He loves it so much that he gave me this encoded bacon-themed flag (he said he was inspired by the sound of sizzling bacon).

It is necessary to replace the 'S' and 's' with 'A' and 'B' respectively in order to use CyberChef.
There is no need to reinvent the wheel.

With CyberChef:

- Bacon_Cipher_Decode('Complete','A/B',false)

```
UTFLAGCRISPYBACONCIPHER
```

We just have to add the braces and we get the flag:
```
UTFLAG{CRISPYBACONCIPHER}
```
